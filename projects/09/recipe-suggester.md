# 🧠 GitHub Copilot Instructions for Recipe Suggestion Web App Based on Ingredients

## 📌 Project Overview
**Recipe Suggestion App** is a mid-complexity web application that allows users to input ingredients they have on hand and receive personalized recipe recommendations. It solves a common problem for home cooks unsure of what to cook and helps reduce food waste by using existing ingredients.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- User inputs a list of available ingredients
- App suggests matching recipes from a structured database/API
- Recipe detail page with ingredients, steps, images
- Filter recipes by preparation time, difficulty, or dietary restrictions (premium)
- Allow users to rate recipes and save favorites
- Optional: enable users to upload and share their own recipes

### Monetization Options
- Display ads in the free version
- Premium version unlocks:
  - Advanced dietary filters (e.g., vegan, gluten-free)
  - Weekly meal planning
  - Exclusive chef-created or influencer-submitted recipes
  - Cloud-based user profiles and sync features

## 🧭 Copilot Instructions
### 🔹 Ingredient Input
```plaintext
Create an input form that allows users to type or select ingredients from a suggestion list. Support comma-separated input and dynamic tag generation.
```

### 🔹 Recipe Matching Logic
```plaintext
Implement fuzzy matching logic or tag intersection to find recipes that match the most entered ingredients. Optionally score recipes based on match percentage.
```

### 🔹 Recipe API Integration or DB
```plaintext
Use a public recipe API (like Spoonacular, Edamam) or build a custom recipe database with indexed tags. Store ingredients and categories in normalized form.
```

### 🔹 Recipe Viewer UI
```plaintext
Design a card-style list of recipe previews with image, title, prep time, and tags. Clicking a recipe shows full details including instructions and nutrition info.
```

### 🔹 User Features (Optional Login)
```plaintext
Enable users to create accounts to save favorites, review recipes, or submit their own. Use Firebase Auth or JWT.
```

### 🔹 Premium Subscription Features
```plaintext
Use Stripe or other payment processors to manage subscriptions. Add access control middleware to lock premium features behind a paywall.
```

## ✅ Suggested Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (recipes, users, ingredients)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth, Clerk, or JWT
- **Payments**: Stripe or LemonSqueezy
